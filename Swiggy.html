                <h1>About Swiggy</h1>
                <p>Swiggy is a leading food ordering and delivery startup in India. The company started operations in 2014 and is headquartered in Bengaluru. Swiggy works by acting as a bridge between customers and restaurants. It utilizes an innovative technology platform that allows customers to order food from nearby restaurants and get it delivered at their doorstep. With Swiggy, customers do not have to keep the contact numbers of various restaurants and eateries in their locality. Swiggy works as a single point of contact for ordering food from all restaurants that may be there at a particular location. Swiggy has its own team of delivery professionals who pickup orders from restaurants and deliver it at the customer’s doorstep. This has made the task of ordering food a lot easier for customers. Restaurants also gain by getting more orders and avoiding costs and efforts associated with maintaining their own delivery personnel.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>The idea for Swiggy came in 2014, when the founders realized that there was a huge gap in the food ordering and delivery space. Restaurants often faced manpower problems and their delivery personnel were also not trained to deliver food in time. Swiggy started as a small setup in August 2014, with a team of six delivery personnel and covering 25 restaurants. However, the idea soon became a huge hit among customers and restaurants alike. Swiggy now has operations in 8 cities and more than 10,000 restaurants on its platform.</p>
